<!--What is AR/VR/AV/MR/XR and how do the terminologies compare?-->
- **AR** is an addition of virtual objects into the real world, the objects appear as if they were actually existing.
- **VR** is a virtual digital space where one can immerse completely into so that he/she feels like being present in that space.
-  **AV** is an addition of objects from the real world into a digitally created virtual space. (Kind of like a switched AR)
- **MR** is a mix of adding virtual and real objects together to create new environments where those objects coexist in real time.
- **XR** is like and umbrella concept for all those above, meaning all augmented and virtual reality is a subclass of XR.

<!--How do XR applications compare to traditional desktop and mobile applications? Advantages/disadvantages?-->
Traditional desktop or mobile applications are just 2D dimensions, therefore the immersiveness of those is not such large (as we humans are used to 3D), whereas with XR applications its like going up in one dimension. Suddenly you can move in 3D which enhances the overall experience greatly but has a few downfalls as well (fx. motion sickness).

Advantages of XR applications:
- More immersive experience
- Spatial computing
- Rich and intuitive interactions (motion and rotation sensors)
- Can simulate any other media and environment

Disadvantages of XR applications:
- Motion sickness
- Comfort (for example a headsets are still pretty heavy and you can feel it after some time)
- Not yet adoptable for a mass production

In the first Iron Man movie, when Tony Stark was creating his suit, he worked with hologram of the suit, he could add some parts, view them more detailed or remove them. Nowadays, engineers use extended reality to visualize buildings, structures or machines they are going to build. During recruitment phase, new employee can use Virtual reality that accurately mimic on-the-job scenarios, which can significantly improve performance, without employees being physicaly on workspace, or using the device they should work with. Doctors can train surgeries, professionals can assists with repairs remotely, thanks to the digital twins, students can learn faster and people can interact with each other in digital 3D space. Last but not least, virtual reality brings whole new experience to gaming, comparing to traditional gaming with 2D monitor, mouse or controllers. 
Above mentioned scenarios are just a few use cases of XR, as it is large, quickly growing segment, with many investments and new ideas coming to the industry. 

With XR, people can train extreme and dangerous scenarios without risking injury, trainees can operate and interact with expensive machinery without the risk of causing any damage or wear and tear, ensuring both the safety of the equipment and the operator. Also education and healthcare can be more personalized, which could lead to better results.

<!--How is input technology and interactions different in XR?--!>
Standard input technology includes using controllers, keyboards, buttons, mice, and joysticks to interact with programs. 

In contrast, XR allows for several different types of input when compared to standard ways. Augmented reality can use hand gestures, voice, touch screen input, gyroscopic movement, eye tracking, and more. Virtual reality most commonly uses tracking of handheld motion controllers, body tracking through cameras, and other periphials that can track movement within the virtual space. 

These different input technologies provide for interactions beyond traditional user experiences. Augmented reality can overlay digital objects on the real world, meaning the interactions blend both the real and virtual spaces. This provides a new way to interact with the world around us. Virtual reality allows a fully immersive environment where physical interactions can take place inside a world seperate from reality.

<!--What problems can XR solve?--!>
XR technology allows for solutions to many problems â€“ from accessibility, risk-aversion, safety, collaboration, costs of training, therapy, and a lot more.
