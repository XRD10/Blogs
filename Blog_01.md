## Answer 1
<!--What is AR/VR/AV/MR/XR and how do the terminologies compare?-->
**AR** is an addition of virtual objects into the real world, the objects appear as if they were actually existing.
**VR** is a virtual digital space where one can immerse completely into so that he/she feels like being present in that space.
**AV** is an addition of objects from the real world into a digitally created virtual space. (Kind of like a switched AR)
**MR** is a mix of adding virtual and real objects together to create new environments where those objects coexist in real time.
**XR** is like and umbrella concept for all those above, meaning all augmented and virtual reality is a subclass of XR.

## Answer 2
<!--How do XR applications compare to traditional desktop and mobile applications? Advantages/disadvantages?-->
Traditional desktop or mobile applications are just 2D dimensions, therefore the immersiveness of those is not such large (as we humans are used to 3D), whereas with XR applications its like going up in one dimension. Suddenly you can move in 3D which enhances the overall experience greatly but has a few downfalls as well (fx. motion sickness).

Advantages of XR applications:
- More immersive experience
- Spatial computing
- Rich and intuitive interactions (motion and rotation sensors)
- Can simulate any other media and environment

Disadvantages of XR applications:
- Motion sickness
- Comfort (for example a headsets are still pretty heavy and you can feel it after some time)
- Not yet adoptable for a mass production
