### General reflections
At the end of the semester I thought AR will be an easier than VR in terms of development and I was wrong. I am not sure if it was the selection of the topic for the project itself that made it harder but we struggled with it a lot (at least that was my feeling). Based on that, I wish there was more time dedicated to developing the VR project, as the school has dedicated headsets on which the testing is much better. 

From the lecture perspective, I understand that this course is build mainly on us resarching and implementing the projects, but I think it would be beneficial the teacher could do like an introductory demo of setting up project specific scenes in the class. We get access to some already made demos but the reverse engineering takes quite some time and it feels like you are just spending time on basic stuff that could be done in few minutes if you knew how. I for example, struggled with understanding how to create a custom script for interactable, as I needed a grabable object that would stay in place (a joystick) and there was not enough guidance/explanantion online (I just ended up getting pre-implemented script but had to spend additional time on fine tuning it).

### AR Project
First of all, testing on samsung is basically impossible, as it just doesn't scan the wall properly, you have to realy move it around and hope it will register something on the wall for registering the plane (even on walls with a lot of decoration).
