We decided to use the AR Project Template as a base for our project, because it contained a few features already implemented, like object placement, object rotation etc. However, after some time we have run into few issues, as the methods were too complex for us. We therefore decided to start again with blank project. We created XR Origin, AR Session and EventSystem and implemented requirements 1 and 3.

At the end of the meeting, requirements 1,3 and 7 are completed. Other requirements are in progress and we expect that the MVP will be finished by Friday 4th. 

On next meeting we will do small demo of the application and also decide on next requirements.
