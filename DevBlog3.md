## Process
We experienced bit of a difficulty while trying to finish our MVP on time, some of the tasks were a bit more complex than we originaly expected (especially placing an object in the correct orientation or not being able to move placed objects into each other).

To make out for it, we refactored fome of the tasks and only implemented the parts that were really necessary for our MVP so that the team could move forward and start with implementing the core features. We also did a few pair programming / debuging sessions to speed up the progress.

## Implementation
