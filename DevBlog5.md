# X-Wing VR - Part 2

## Process
We stayed on time with almost all of our planned tasks for the MVP (with 2 tasks in progress and almost done with 1 day left):

All the team worked together in the XR lab which helped us to close some discussions and come up with clear goals to achieve until the XR expo.


## Development
Within the MVP milestone we completed the following:
- Found a X-Wing 3D model that we divided into separate parts as needed (joystick and thrust controller) in Blender.
- Created `FlightController` and `VRFlightController` (one of them serves for gamepad / XR controller input, the other converts joystick and thrust position into speed and rotation)
- Added engine sound
- Added shooting
- Added a universe skybox
- Added meteorites

### 3D object movement into flight controls
Since this project is very time limited, we did not want to waste all of the time on creating many custom components, therefore we took a `XRSlider` and `XRJoystick` controllers from a unity package called **Lets make a VR game** from **[Valem Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@ValemTutorials)**. We changed the visuals for our 3D objects that we divided from a previous X Wing model in Blender and created a special `VRFlightController` which takes an input of the thrust/joystick 's position and converts it into a speed and rotation of the spaceship.

The way this works is as follows, the `XRSlider` and `XRJoystick` scripts are emitting unity events with the object's position:

_an example from the `XRJoystick` controller in the editor_


And that is then listened for by the `VRFlightController`'s functions:

As can be seen in the figure above, the `OnThrustChange` function is converting the input into real speed with the help of the `Lerp` function.

Then there is an `Update` function in the `VRFlightController` that takes all the latest input and converts it into a valid speed/rotation of the spaceship.

### Customization of the `XRJoystick` script
Using pre-created scripts from an imported unity package is a huge help in terms of development speed, however it often brings a few issues along, as there usually is some desired functionality that is not included and then you have to change it manually, this can be a tough process if the used script is complex and hard to understand. Luckily for us, we only needed few minor changes that we were able to implement after diving into the code for some time:

#### Disabling rotation of the joystick alongside its y axis
While testing, we noticed that at certain point, the joystick started to rotate in a weird way alongside the y axis. Since our joystick shape is not straight, it was a distractive element and we wanted to get rid of it. We found out, that there was a function that was setting the joystick's rotation called `SetHandleAngle` and all that needed to be done was to set the y angle update to 0:

#### Hiding an XR controller/hand on joystick grab
To bring more realism into our game we used animated hands instead of controllers in the scene from the previously mentioned **Lets make a VR game** package. We noticed that when grabbing the controller, it would snap to a wrist position of the hand instead of a palm. While trying to find a solution to this issue we realized it would probably be best if we hid the hand while grabbing the joystick (a solution many VR games apply) so that it isclear that the player is controlling it.

We added both hand as GameObject to the `XRJoystick` script and made a simple logic in the `StartGrab` and `EndGrab` functions, where we check the name of the Interactor grabbin the object and since our custom naming is following a clear structure of `Right_InteractorName` and `Left_InteractorName` for both hands we only check for the beggining of the string and based on that we disable/enable the corresponding hand object:

### Imperial Star Destroyer and implementation of LOD
The implementation of LOD system allows our Star Destroyer model to maintain optimal performance across various viewing distances. We have removed some groups that are not important for larger distances in Blender. The resulting models were then imported into Unity, where we set up a StarDestroyer prefab with LOD group components with three distinct detail levels. The technical specifications of each LOD level are in the figure below.

This LOD implementation provides significant performance optimization:
- 80% polygon reduction at medium distances (LOD1)
- 97% polygon reduction at long distances (LOD2)
- Automatic transition between detail levels based on viewing distance

### Meteorites
Meteorites were added to the game to enhance the game experience. For meteorites was used **[Asteroid Asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/asteroids-pack-84988)**
from Unity asset store. From a meteorite included in the asset was created prefab called Asteroid field, which includes a huge amount of meteorites. Asteroid fiels were added in multiple places in the game scene. To make the meteorite rotate around it's own axis was created `AsteroidMovement` script. On the figure bellow can be seen simple method that is using Angular Velocity to rotate the Meteorite in random directions.

In the figure bellow can be seen asteroid field that was added to game scene. For the purpose of the MVP were meteorites with rotation functionality just added to the scene. However the team decided that in the upcoming week will be developed as well meteorite explosion in case that the X-Wing or enemy rocket would collide with it.

### Player shooting
One of the core parts of the game was the ability for the X-Wing to shoot. 
Shooting is a regularly implemented feature of games, so it was straight-forward to know that it would require:
- A laser prefab object
- A projectile script
- A firing controller script

To start with, a laser prefab was created simply using a stretched 3D object with a collider. The projectile script added to the prefab contains simple information including speed, damage, time to live, and a way to keep the projectile heading in the correct direction. The Enemy laser prefab variant was coloured green, and the Player laser prefab variant was coloured red.
A more interesting part was creating the firing controller, particularly in order to control the firing sequence of the X-Wing.

````
    [Header("----Laser Settings----")]
    public string laserTag = "PlayerLaser";
    public float fireRate;
    public float laserSpeed;
    public int damage;
    [SerializeField]
    GameObject laserPrefab;
    public AudioSource laserAudioSource;

    [Header("----Meta----")]
    public bool isFiring = false;
    private Coroutine firingCoroutine;

    [Header("----Firing points----")]
    [Tooltip("Adjust firing order here")]
    [SerializeField]
    Transform[] laserOrigins;
    private int currentLaserIndex = 0;

    [Header("----Target point----")]
    [Tooltip("Set where the lasers should aim")]
    [SerializeField]
    Transform targetPoint;
````
The FiringController class for the player sets all the information for the shooting timing and spawnpoint for the projectiles, and passes speed, damage and target location to the newly spawned objects.
One of the fun elements was utilising a co-routine to handle the firing, which allows setting a pause between shots and makes it easy to cycle through each of the firing locations making a circular firing pattern. This can be easily edited to make different firing patterns.
````
{
     private IEnumerator FireContinuously()
         float cycleTime = laserOrigins.Length / fireRate;

        // Time between individual laser shots
        float timeBetweenShots = cycleTime / laserOrigins.Length;

        while (isFiring)
        {
            FireSingleLaser(laserOrigins[currentLaserIndex]);

            currentLaserIndex = (currentLaserIndex + 1) % laserOrigins.Length;

            // Wait for the specified time before firing the next laser
            float elapsedTime = 0f;
            while (elapsedTime < timeBetweenShots)
            {
                if (!isFiring)
                    yield break;

                elapsedTime += Time.deltaTime;
                yield return null;
            }
        }
        
    private void FireSingleLaser(Transform origin)
    {
        
        Vector3 direction = (targetPoint.position - origin.position).normalized;

        GameObject laser = Instantiate(laserPrefab, origin.position, Quaternion.LookRotation(direction));
        laserAudioSource.Play();
        Projectile projectile = laser.GetComponent<Projectile>();
        projectile.speed = laserSpeed;
        projectile.damage = damage; 
        projectile.targetPosition = targetPoint.position;
    }
}
````

Once the input action to fire is triggered, the isFiring boolean is set to True and the Co-routine FireContinuously is called. While 'isFiring' is active, the loop calls the FireSingleLaser() method and cycles through the array of firepoints. Additionally, the while-loop introduces a slight delay before firing the next laser from the next firing location. This simple co-routine allows for controlling a more exciting and fun firing pattern that is very responsive and more immersive.

However being able to shoot is not useful if you don't have a target, therefore it was necessary to also implement...
