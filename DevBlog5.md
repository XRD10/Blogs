# X-Wing VR - Part 2

## Process
We stayed on time with almost all of our planned tasks for the MVP (with 2 tasks in progress and almost done with 1 day left):

All the team worked together in the XR lab which helped us to close some discussions and come up with clear goals to achieve until the XR expo.


## Development
Within the MVP milestone we completed the following:
- Found a X-Wing 3D model that we divided into separate parts as needed (joystick and thrust controller) in Blender.
- Created `FlightController` and `VRFlightController` (one of them serves for gamepad / XR controller input, the other converts joystick and thrust position into speed and rotation)
- Added engine sound
- Added shooting
- Added a universe skybox
