We started with setup for VR game that will allow player to step into the world of Star Wars! Player will be able to fly his X-Wing through space, engage in fights with enemy interceptors, and experience the thrill of Star Wars-style space combat.
May the force be with you, pilot!

## Development

### Environment

We started with creation of environment. This was achieved by creating SkyBox from .exr image, that shows a view of outer space with a planet in the lower part of the frame.

### 3d Models

For the X-Wing cockpit, we combined two models: one had textures but lacked a thrust controller, while the other included the controller but no textures. We separated the controller from the latter model and applied new textures to complete the setup. This process was done in Blender, following clear, helpful instructions from a teacher’s lesson on Blender. Model now has 2 objects that are separated. Thrust controler, that will controll speed and flying stick, which will allow the pilot to maneuver the X-Wing and control its flight dynamics. Final cockpit view looks like this:
