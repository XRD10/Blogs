# X-Wing VR - Virtual Reality Project

Our Virtual Reality game will allow players to step into the role of Star Wars pilot! Players will be able to fly a X-Wing spaceship through the space, engage in fights against enemy 
TIE interceptors, and experience the thrill of Star Wars-style space combat.

May the force be with you, pilot!

## Development

### Environment

We started with creation of the environment. This was achieved by creating a SkyBox from .exr image, that shows a view of outer space with a planet in the lower part of the frame.

### 3D Models

For the X-Wing cockpit, we combined two models: one had textures but lacked a thrust and rotation controllers, while the other included the controllers but no textures. We separated the controllers from the latter model and applied to the one with textures to complete the setup. This process was done in Blender, following clear and helpful instructions from Kasper's lesson on Blender. The model now has 2 objects that are separated. Thrust controler, that will controll speed and flying joystick, which will allow the pilot to maneuver the X-Wing and control its flight dynamics. The final cockpit view looks like this:

### Flight Controller

Since this has been developed during the separation of 3D models as described above, ew focused mainly on the functionality of the controller. We used the new input system and defined 2 Actions:

- Pitch + Yaw
- Thrust + Roll

Each of them if basically stick on either gamepad or xr controller (so that we can test the game in VR mode as well):

For speed we check whether the input if above or below 0 and based on that we accelerate/slowdown (if 0 then the speed stays constant) and we make sure that we do not go over certain minima/maxima. In the update method we then assing each rotation value and speed to the transform component of the object that has the `FlightController` script as shown in the figure below:

The next goal is to connect the 3D separated thrust and rotation controllers to the functionality of the script.
